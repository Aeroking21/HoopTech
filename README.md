# Code (Hardware)

## Sensors used and its respective library file:

- the pulse sensor along with ADC (ADS1115) module - `ads1115.py`
- accelerometer (LIS3DH) - `lis3dh.py`
- time-of-flight (VL53L0X) ranging sensor - `VL53L0X.py`

A buzzer (GPIO 10) and LED (GPIO 27) as outputs to indicate that the baskets have been made.

All libraries have been implemented by using the I2C functions in the `smbus2` library as instructed.

## Handling multiple tasks concurrently

- **Threading** was implemented to collect data at different rates with the 3 different sensors.
- 4 main tasks:
  - Measure pulse rate
  - Track score
  - Track maximum acceleration
  - Send data over MQTT (every 1s)

## Accelerometer Code

- Commented out code def shakeCode() is the code to measure the vibrations of the basketball rim
- Measures the average acceleration in specified time frame
- Compares this to two thresholds to determine whether there is a lot or a little shaking and then defines the accuracy as A, B, or C (where A is no vibration)
